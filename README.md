## Project Title:
    bigbytessquad

## Project Description:
    One goal of the university is to get an internship. However, in most cases, it is a catch-22 where you need experience to get experience. However, attending a school like UCLA provides students with a vast network of alumni. The goal of this application will be to create a platform that connects students to alumni with the goal of alumni advocating for UCLA students.
    This will be accomplished by alumni posting internships available at their company, and positions they are willing to refer someone to. Students can then upload their resume and a short bio about themselves. If the Alumni feel they have a strong candidate then they will refer them to the position, through the internal referral program that most large corporations have.
    The motivation that alumni have is that they will be giving back to the community, and one day this will be expanded outside of internships but also into full-time roles. However, there will also be opportunities for these alumni to offer mentorship if they are unable to refer a student. Thus this can help to build up relationships with students and alumni. Ultimately, this will help students get industry experience, with the goal being that when they graduate they will help return the favor.

## Installation Process:
    1. Clone from GitHub repo
    2. Navigate to the bigbytes/bigbyte directory and create the following file to store and initialize the Firebase API keys:
        - .env
    3. Navigate to the bigbytes root directory and execute the start script start_app.sh which does the following: 
        - installs all Firebase and Firebase Admin dependencies
        - installs npm throughout the project
        - navigates to the front end and back end folders, installs npm, and starts both servers to effectively launch the application
    4. A new React application host will startup in localhost:3000 with backend functionality in localhost:3001


## Backups:
Assuming the project is installed and you navigate to the /Backend folder with proper admin access. Run the terminal command below 'export' to save your current data and 'import' to rewrite the exported data to the database

Naming convention: backup[x].json - backup1.json, backup2.json, etc
1. export data (you can also specify a file path before your backup file name): npx -p node-firestore-import-export firestore-export -a FBAdmin.json -b backup[x].json
2. import data (ensure the correct filepath is appended to backup file name): npx -p node-firestore-import-export firestore-import -a FBAdmin.json -b backup[x].json
